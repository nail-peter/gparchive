PWA Icon Requirements
======================

You need two icon files for the PWA to work on iPhone:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

Quick Ways to Create:

Option 1 - Online Tool:
- Visit: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Upload any image or create simple design
- Download 192x192 and 512x512 sizes

Option 2 - Simple Design:
- Black background (#000000)
- White text "GP" in center
- Use any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)

Option 3 - Use Emoji:
- Create image with 🎵 or 🎧 emoji on black background
- Export at required sizes

Temporary Workaround:
- The app will work without icons
- iPhone will use a screenshot of the page as icon
- Add proper icons later for better appearance
